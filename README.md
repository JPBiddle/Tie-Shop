## Introduction

Welcome to my README for Monty & Turner's Tie Emporium, an excellent place to find a great selection of high quality ties. The purpose of this website is to allow new and existing customers to browse a range of ties in an intuitive way and easily find information regarding the ties. 

The customers will of course be able to purchase a tie and this will involve signing up and logging into their personal account. Ease of use is very important as a frustrated customer is less likely to make a purchase. The aim was to allow the purchase of a tie in as few steps as possible.

This was the fourth Milestone Projects as part of my course at the Code Institute. The main requirements were to make a full stack django project, with multiple apps, use of stripe payment, at least one form of validation, an authentication method, some frontend javascript and finally at least two custom django models.
