## Introduction

Welcome to my README for Monty & Turner's Tie Emporium, an excellent place to find a great selection of high quality ties. The purpose of this website is to allow new and existing customers to browse a range of ties in an intuitive way and easily find information regarding the ties. 

The customers will of course be able to purchase a tie and this will involve signing up and logging into their personal account. Ease of use is very important as a frustrated customer is less likely to make a purchase. The aim was to allow the purchase of a tie in as few steps as possible.

This was the fourth Milestone Projects as part of my course at the Code Institute. The main requirements were to make a full stack django project, with multiple apps, use of stripe payment, at least one form of validation, an authentication method, some frontend javascript and finally at least two custom django models.

## Development Planes



#### Strategy

To design a site that fits the users needs, the following development planes were consulted to assist with answering the user stories.

- roles

  - Current users
  - New Users


- Demographic
  - Interested in menswear
  - Adults
  - Seeking high quality men's accessories
  - Western demographic, focus on united kingdom

- Psychographic
  - Lifestyles
    - Potential office workers
    - Users who frequently adpot formal attire

- Personality and Attitudes 
  - Professionals
  - Attention to detail
  - Social

- Values
  - Focus on maintaining smart appearance
  - Appreciates high quality 
  - Appreciates wide choice of selective items

This website needs to enable the user to:

- Create an account and login
- Purchase a tie or multiple ties
- Edit and save user info (email, physical address)
- Contact the site owner
- visit site social links

This website needs to enable the owner to:

- Display available products
- Provide a point of contact
- Provide information about the site


With this in mind I have produced a short diagram representing the viability of elements versus importance within the site.
